            utilization quite often, a task often made even more difficult with the work from home
            environment recent years have created.This could range from assigning resources to make
            the most of their available skills to identifying
            skills currently lacking in the business
            based on projects being attained. This interactive web application sets out to streamline
            these processes by effectively managing recources, streamlining the management process to
            increase team efficiency and project development time.
