            Working in a development-based environment has managers managing resource allocation and
            utilization quite often, a task often made even more difficult with the work from home
            environment recent years have created. This could range from assigning resources to make
             the most of their available skills to identifying skills currently lacking in the business
             based on projects being attained. This interactive web application sets out to streamline
             these processes by effectively managing recources, streamlining the management process to
             increase team efficiency and project development time.
