                        Working in a development-based environment has managers managing resource allocation and 
                        utilization quite often, a task often made even more difficult with the work from home 
                        environment recent years have created. This could range from assigning resources to make
                         the most of their available skills to identifying skills currently lacking in the business
                         based on projects being attained. This interactive web application sets out to streamline
                         these processes by effectively managing recources, streamlining the management process to 
                         increase team efficiency and project development time.
